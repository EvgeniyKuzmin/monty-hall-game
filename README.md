# Monty-Hall game simulator
Windowed application to demonstrate the Monty Hall paradox.

## Description
The Monty Hall problem is a brain teaser, in the form of a probability puzzle.
> Suppose you're on a game show, and you're given the choice of three doors:
> Behind one door is a car; behind the others, goats. You pick a door,
> say No. 1, and the host, who knows what's behind the doors, opens another
> door, say No. 3, which has a goat. He then says to you, "Do you want to pick
> door No. 2?" Is it to your advantage to switch your choice?

Even when given explanations, simulations, and formal mathematical proofs, 
many people still do not accept that switching is the best strategy
